h1. YUI Bootstrapper for Node.js

This node.js module attempts to setup and bootstrap a working YUI 3 instance.

This module includes support for remote script loading via Y.Get.script() and remote data fetching via Y.io.

See "JSDom Support" below for DOM manipulation.

h2. Setup this repo

Clone this project, then do this:
<pre class="console">
    cd nodejs-yui3/lib
    git clone git://github.com/yui/yui3.git
</pre>

You should go into that repo every now and then and do a git pull to keep it up to date with the latest YUI source.


h2. Node.js

These tests and examples are all known to be working with latest stable Node.js: v0.1.33

All of the examples and tests assume you nave @node@ in your path and they are all executable.


h2. JSDom Support

Currently YUI 3 on Node.js supports "JSDom":http://github.com/tmpvar/jsom
It also requires my forked "node-htmlparser":http://github.com/davglass/node-htmlparser

Getting it up and running:

<pre class="console">
    mkdir ~/.node_libraries
    cd ~/.node_libraries
    wget http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/raw/master/lib/level1/core.js -O jsdom.js
    wget http://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/raw/master/lib/browser/index.js -O browser.js
    wget http://github.com/davglass/node-htmlparser/raw/master/node-htmlparser.js
</pre>

Now that the libraries are in the right places you can now use the dom related examples.

h2. Examples

<pre class="console">
    cd examples/
    ./general-dom.js
    ./io.js
    ./library.js
</pre>

h2. Tests

When using JSDom, All relevent YUI 3 Dom & Selector tests pass. The ones that are skipped revolve around styles and postioning. Since there is no window or CSS cascade, these seem unimportant at the moment.

<pre class="console">
    cd ./tests/
    ./dom.js
    ./selector.js
</pre>
